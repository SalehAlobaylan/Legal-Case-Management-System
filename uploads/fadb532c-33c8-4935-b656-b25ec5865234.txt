SECTION 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This file concerns a labor dispute arising from alleged delayed salary payments, disputed commission calculations, and termination without lawful cause or adequate procedural notice. The claimant states that his base salary was delayed repeatedly between October 2025 and January 2026, and variable commission payments for three major contracts were withheld. The respondent states that the claimant failed to meet internal sales compliance procedures and that certain commissions were contingent upon client collections that did not clear.

The claimant seeks unpaid wages, unpaid commissions, end-of-service benefits, payment in lieu of notice, compensation for arbitrary dismissal, and reimbursement of business expenses allegedly advanced personally for customer meetings and logistics.

The respondent rejects most financial claims, admits minor payroll delay for one cycle due to banking integration issues, and argues termination was due to poor performance and policy breaches documented in internal warnings.

SECTION 3: EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP BACKGROUND
3.1 Contract Formation
The claimant signed an employment contract dated March 1, 2023. The contract indicates:

SECTION 6: CLAIMANT STATEMENT (LONG FORM)
I, Yasser Ibrahim Al-Harthi, was employed in good standing and consistently contributed to revenue growth. I repeatedly informed management that delayed salary payments were causing personal hardship. My landlord issued payment reminders in November and December 2025 due to payroll delays. I also advanced business expenses from personal funds for approved meetings because procurement approvals were slow. Despite my contributions, I was treated unfairly.

Regarding warnings, I dispute their basis. CRM entries were delayed because the system was frequently unavailable and because support staff responsible for uploading signed delivery receipts had backlog issues. I requested technical logs to prove outages, but no complete logs were provided to me before the disciplinary meeting. I also requested that commissions be calculated based on signed contracts, not delayed customer settlement cycles outside my control.

The termination was abrupt and damaged my professional reputation. I was escorted from premises and denied access to retrieve personal files until two days later. I was not given a meaningful opportunity to defend myself with complete evidence. The notice period in my contract is 60 days, yet my employment ended immediately. I request full rights under labor law, payment in lieu of notice, and compensation for arbitrary dismissal.

SECTION 7: RESPONDENT STATEMENT (LONG FORM)
Al-Madina Industrial Supplies LLC denies arbitrary dismissal. The claimant received multiple coaching sessions, documented policy reminders, and formal warnings. Sales governance in our regulated procurement pipeline is strict, and unauthorized discount practices expose the company to compliance and audit risks. The claimant repeatedly failed to record complete client interaction notes in CRM and bypassed approval workflows.

The company acknowledges minor payroll processing delays linked to external banking integration but denies systemic non-payment. Any temporary delay was corrected within operational windows. Commission payments are contractually tied to collected receivables, not merely signed deals. Several deals referenced by the claimant had unresolved customer disputes and delayed settlement, so commission was not yet payable under policy.

The disciplinary process followed internal policy. The claimant attended the meeting and was allowed to respond. Termination was based on cumulative policy breaches and documented performance concerns, not retaliation for salary complaints.

SECTION 8: FINANCIAL CLAIM BREAKDOWN
8.1 Unpaid Base Salary Components (Claimant Position)
October 2025 shortfall: SAR 3,100
November 2025 shortfall: SAR 2,450

Total commission claimed: SAR 56,650

8.5 End-of-Service Benefits (Estimated by Claimant)
Service period counted from March 1, 2023 to February 1, 2026

SECTION 12: WITNESS SUMMARIES
Witness 1: Laila M. (Payroll Specialist)
Confirms two payroll runs were delayed due to external banking API failures.
States all core salaries were eventually processed.
Cannot confirm commission eligibility criteria interpretation.

Witness 2: Saad R. (Sales Operations Analyst)
States CRM completion rates for claimant dropped in Q4 2025.
Notes internal support backlog could have contributed to incomplete attachments.

Witness 3: Huda A. (HR Director)
Confirms warning letters were issued according to policy matrix.
States claimant attended disciplinary meeting and signed attendance sheet.

Witness 4: Faisal K. (Senior Account Manager, former team lead)
Claims claimant regularly secured high-value deals and that back-office delays often affected reconciliation.

SECTION 13: PRELIMINARY LEGAL ANALYSIS MEMO (INTERNAL DRAFT)
The case appears mixed on liability. Payroll delay evidence is credible but financial magnitude remains contested. Commission entitlement depends heavily on contract language and historical payment practice. If prior commissions were routinely paid upon invoice issuance rather than cash collection, claimant may establish implied practice argument. If policy text and prior records confirm cash-collection trigger, respondent defense strengthens.

Termination proportionality is a central risk area for respondent. If evidence shows process defects, missing disclosure, or pretextual motive linked to wage complaints, arbitrary dismissal exposure increases. Respondent should preserve complete CRM logs, warning issuance workflow records, and attendance documents from disciplinary proceedings.

Claimant should consolidate:
- bank statements showing payroll delay effects,
- historical commission payment timing examples,
- manager approvals for disputed discounts and expenses,
- communication proving attempts to cure alleged non-compliance.

3) Payment in lieu of 60-day notice totaling SAR 35,400.

5) Arbitrary dismissal compensation of SAR 53,100.
6) Reimbursement of expenses totaling SAR 8,740.

1) Dismissal of arbitrary dismissal claim.
2) Rejection of commission claims pending receivable trigger satisfaction.
3) Set-off rights for any policy breach losses if proven.
4) Limitation of any award to verified, unpaid contractual amounts only.

SECTION 17: ADDITIONAL FACTUAL NARRATIVE FOR NLP CHUNKING
During Q4 2025 the company experienced operational strain related to a finance system migration, including delayed reconciliation exports and temporary interruption in payroll validation scripts. Multiple employees raised concerns about timing of salary credits, but claimant alleges he was disproportionately affected and singled out after escalating concerns. Internal meeting minutes indicate management instructed teams to “prioritize client collections” and “defer non-critical payouts pending audit clearance,” language the claimant interprets as intentional withholding.

The claimant’s line manager’s chat messages, if authenticated, may show informal approval of discount structures later used as grounds for warning letters. The respondent counters that only formal system approvals are valid and that informal chats cannot override policy. The dispute therefore includes a governance mismatch between practical field operations and formal compliance controls.

The claimant also alleges reputational harm after termination because access badges were deactivated immediately and colleagues were informed that he had committed serious misconduct. The respondent denies defamatory communication and states standard access deactivation is required for information security at termination.

SECTION 18: TECHNICAL EXTRACTION TEST PARAGRAPHS
Paragraph Alpha:
The employee contends that compensation components were delayed and inconsistently paid, with payroll shortfalls recurring over multiple months. The employer contends that delays were temporary and corrected.

Paragraph Beta:
Commission entitlement is disputed because one side relies on signed contracts and performance contribution, while the other side relies on collected receivables and strict policy triggers.

Paragraph Gamma:
The termination process is challenged as procedurally deficient, with allegations of limited evidence disclosure and immediate enforcement despite contractual notice provisions.

Paragraph Delta:
Potential remedies include wage reconciliation, commission adjudication, end-of-service calculations, notice compensation, and assessment of arbitrary dismissal damages.
